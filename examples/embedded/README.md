# Embedded Example

The `embedded` folder was generated by executing:
```bash
embed_helper ./dist
```

---  

The most important part of the `CMakeLists.txt` is the line
```cmake
target_include_directories(webview PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}) # This directory contains the embedded folder - thats why we have to add it as a include directory 
```
